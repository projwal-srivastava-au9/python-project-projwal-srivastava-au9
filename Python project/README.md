## Rules

 1. The board will have 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.
 2. The game is played with two dice instead of 1 and so the total dice value could be between 2 to 12 in a single move.
 3. Each player rolls the dice when their turn comes.
 4. Based on the dice value, the player moves their piece forward that number of cells.
 5. A player wins if it exactly reaches the position 100 and the game ends there.
 6. The board also contains some snakes and ladders.
 7. Each snake will have its head at some number and its tail at a smaller number.
 8. Whenever a piece ends up at a position with the head of the snake, the piece should go down to the position of the tail of that snake.
 9. Each ladder will have its start position at some number and end position at a larger number.
 10. Whenever a piece ends up at a position with the start of the ladder, the piece should go up to the position of the end of that ladder.
